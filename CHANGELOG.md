## Changelog
### 1.1.0
Core features finished and everything is stable. Variables, class, methods, fields, etc.
> **Note:** Method declaration and building should from now on be __SEPARATED__! Else you can't access variables like `this`, `arg1`, `arg2`, .. `argN`

- `1.1.1`: Added basic arrays
- `1.1.2`: Reworked the data type system. An example could be instead of doing `DataType.Integer`, you now do `new IntegerType()`
- `1.1.3`: Added condition system
- `1.1.4`: Added if/else statements
- `1.1.5`: Improved if/else, method calls, creating new classes and rewrote the code
